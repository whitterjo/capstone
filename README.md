For Capstone
This code reads HMDA data from an Azure blob store and creates two curated datasets. The first is used for studying approval rates and the other is used for studying interest rates. Once cleaned and concatenated, the data is read into Random Forest and XG Boost classifiers and regressors. Chi-squared and ANOVA testing is done against the data.
